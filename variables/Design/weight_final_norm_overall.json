  "description": "The normalized sample weight is the overall normalized, calibrated, trimmed, nonresponse adjusted (household and person-level) reciprocal of a participant’s probability of selection into the HCHS/SOL study. The base sample weights, i.e. the reciprocal of a participant’s probability of selection into the HCHS/SOL study, were first adjusted by household-level and person-level non-response. The non-response adjusted sample weights were then trimmed using the selected average percentile that minimizes model MSE within each field center. All sample weights that fell above the selected percentile were trimmed to the selected percentile and the trimmed difference was evenly distributed among all of the non-trimmed sample weights. The trimmed, non-response adjusted sample weights were then calibrated using first the 7-category Hispanic Background distribution and then the 12-category age group/gender distribution using the 2010 Decennial Census. Finally, these calibrated, trimmed, non-response adjusted sample weights were normalized using the weighted mean divided by weighted standard deviation of the entire HCHS/SOL sample to normalize the expanded calibrated sample weights (WEIGHT_Final_Norm_Overall). This final sample weight variable is used for analyses purposes only.",
